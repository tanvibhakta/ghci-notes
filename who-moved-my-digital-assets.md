digital twinning

tracking what food they're consuming and therefore personalising medicine.
In the US these derivative data is protected by HIPAA. In India they don't have these laws, (they're looking to make it, but source?!)

Aadhar is good in terms of KYC etc for the banking sector (what??!!) 
Aadhar has resolved the 'no identity system crisis' (WHAT??!!)
'Aadhar is tehcnologically advanced BECAUSE it can be integrated into everything'

in retail linking is critical because we need to be able to have targetted and personalized marketing /which the customer would want/. 

at this point I think I am going to leave.
