Does a data scientsist really need domain knowledge? 
oanelist 1:
- Pro: can quickly scan and seepotential problems
- Con: inbuilt domain biases manifest in the work.
panelist 2: 
head of adta science at Cummins : No (most are generic, like image processing

fo rperformance and aoption of model, inclusion of domain expert from get-go is required.

2 stages: 
model building
model interpretation - this is when we learn most about the domain

horizontal vs vertical machine learning 



Was there a reveal the model discovered that the domain experts couldn't identify? 

Problem: predict when deal will be closed
turned into: fixing data collection, fixing disclipline etc

Problem: where to provide sales coverage? (IBM)
Solution: should be sales biased, but human bias chases familiar customers, etc

Nerual networks can't be explained (build trust through data), we don't to this to irl experts
issue: data almost always carries these biases with it. 
(wouldn't they solve this issue by just removing inter-dependability? with a good data scientist? though I understand that this is not easy (you'll need domain knowledge to do this!!))


There are two ways to solve the problem: Automate the entire thing and make Domain Expert redundant OR simplify teh domain expert's job to a huge extent such that ex minimal keystrokes for transalation work, etc.  
The second thing would lead to an equilibrium.

narrow AI vs general AI
